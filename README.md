Tools used in the making of this white paper:
This task took way longer than necessary because I am not familiar with AI prompting. The advice I received from another AI user was to have a conversation with AI as I would with a team member. This did help with an approach I used but I still had to break apart each section and add more value than what AI could provide. 
Initially I did use Canva to create visual aspects of the white paper, but it proved futile. I had to go back to Co-pilot who created the images you see in white paper now.
Even though I used AI, and I started with the idea that AI would do most of the work for me, I still had to double check facts, create a point of view from which to do research (AI and academic support).  So, if there are any mistakes in the approach I took with this white paper, it's completely my mistakes. AI only provided data/information I asked for. 

I used Co-pilot to create the HTML and CSS file for me. I still had to do a lot of HTML editing but I used the CSS just the way Co-pilot gave it to me.
